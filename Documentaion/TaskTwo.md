### Implementation Phase:

1. #### Coding:

##### I used the following technologies for the project:

-   HTML (Blade Template, Livewire)
-   CSS (Tailwindcss)
-   JavaScript
-   PHP (Laravel Framework)
-   MySQL
-   Git
-   GitHub

##### I used the following libraries for the project:

-   ##### Frontend technologies:

    -   Tailwindcss: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
    -   Hero icons: Beautiful hand-crafted SVG icons, by the makers of Tailwind CSS.
    -   Laravel Livewire: A full-stack framework for Laravel that provides a simple, yet powerful way to build dynamic UIs.

-   ##### Backend technologies:
    -   Filament: A collection of beautiful full-stack components. For designing the admin dashboard.
    -   Eloquent: An object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database.
    -   the Auth facade: A simple authentication API that provides a variety of common authentication tasks.

#### User Authentication:

-   I have implemented a secure user authentication system in Laravel, utilizing hashed passwords for user security.
-   I have utilized Laravel's built-in session-based authentication tokens to ensure secure user authentication.

##### User Authorization:

-   I have implemented middlewares to protect user and admin routes in the application.
-   I have implemented a middleware that ensures only authenticated users/admins can access their respective routes.
-   Unauthorized access attempts are redirected to the login page, thereby enhancing the security of the application.
-   I have implemented a middleware to check if the user is guest (has logged in or registered) or not.

### Testing Phase:

-   Performed integration tests for backend components, including routes, controllers, and database interactions
-   Ensured proper integration of Laravel Livewire components with backend APIs in frontend integration tests.
-   Evaluated system performance under different loads using tools like JMeter for testing APIs performance.

*   examples on testing using JMeter:

    ![](images/image-28.png)

    ![](images/image-29.png)

    ![](images/image-30.png)

### Deployment phase:

-   Deploying the app may need additional costs which isn't available with me right now.
-   there are lots of ways to deploy laravel apps I will mention two of them:
    -   Laravel Vapor: serverless deployment platform for Laravel, powered by AWS. Launch your Laravel infrastructure on Vapor and fall in love with the scalable simplicity of serverless.
    -   Envoyer: deploys your PHP applications with zero downtime. Just push your code, and let Envoyer deliver your application to one or many servers without interrupting a single customer.

## Maintenance Phase

1. ### Bug Fixes

-   Continuously monitor the system for any reported bugs or issues.
-   Utilize Laravel's debugging tools like Telescope to identify the root causes of problems.
-   Implement and test bug fixes using Laravel's testing suite (PHPUnit), ensuring that they do not introduce new issues.

2. ### Performance Monitoring

-   Utilize monitoring tools like Laravel Horizon or third-party services to track the system's performance.
-   Identify and address any performance bottlenecks or areas of improvement using Laravel's profiling and optimization techniques.

3. ### Security Updates

-   Stay informed about security updates for Laravel framework and other dependencies used in the project.
-   Apply security patches promptly by updating Laravel and its dependencies to the latest versions.

4. ### Database Optimization

-   Analyze and optimize database queries using Laravel's Eloquent ORM to improve overall system performance.
-   Implement indexing and caching strategies using Laravel's caching mechanisms and query optimization techniques.

# Advantages and Drawbacks

### Laravel (Backend)

-   **Advantages**:
    -   **Eloquent ORM**: Provides a simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that table.
    -   **MVC Architecture**: Laravel follows the MVC pattern, ensuring clarity between logic and presentation. This design pattern allows changes to be made to the UI without affecting the business logic and vice versa.
-   **Drawbacks**:
    -   **Learning Curve**: Laravel comes with its own directory structure which could be overwhelming for new developers.

### Livewire

-   **Advantages**:
    -   **Simplicity**: Livewire allows you to build dynamic interfaces directly from Laravel blade views, simple directives are used in the blade views.
-   **Drawbacks**:
    -   **Performance**: Livewire can be slower compared to a solution implemented in Vue.js or React.js.

### Filament

-   **Advantages**:
    -   **Admin Panel**: Filament is a set of tools for rapidly building beautiful TALL stack interfaces.
-   **Drawbacks**:
    -   **Limited Community Support**: As Filament is relatively new, the community support might not be as extensive as other established packages.

### MySQL using Eloquent ORM

-   **Advantages**:
    -   **ACID Compliance**: MySQL is ACID compliant which ensures the reliability of transactions.
    -   **Popularity**: MySQL is widely adopted, and there exists a large community of developers who can help answer questions or resolve issues.
-   **Drawbacks**:
    -   **Scaling**: While MySQL can be scaled, it's not as easy to do as with some NoSQL databases.

### Autoprefixer, PostCSS, PostCSS-Nesting

-   **Advantages**:
    -   **Browser Compatibility**: Autoprefixer adds vendor prefixes to your CSS so that styles work across different browsers.
    -   **Advanced Transformations**: PostCSS allows you to use tomorrowâ€™s CSS syntax today, and PostCSS-Nesting enables nested CSS rules.
-   **Drawbacks**:
    -   **Additional Build Steps**: These tools add additional steps to your build process.

### Axios

-   **Advantages**:
    -   **Simplicity**: Axios provides a simple API for making HTTP requests and works great with Vue.js.
-   **Drawbacks**:
    -   **Overhead**: For simple projects, the additional features of Axios might be unnecessary.

### Laravel Vite Plugin, Tailwind CSS, and Vite

-   **Advantages**:
    -   **Performance**: Vite provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It works great with Vue.js and Laravel.
