# Full Stack Solution for Dern-Support

## Business Context and Problem Summary

Dern-Support is a small IT technical support company that provides repair services for computer systems to businesses and individual customers. The company is seeking to expand its services and improve its operations. The current process requires business customers to receive on-site support, while individual customers must physically deliver their computers to the company's offices or arrange for courier delivery.

The challenge is to design a software solution that can streamline these processes and provide a more efficient and user-friendly service.

## Proposed Solution and Requirements

The proposed solution is a full-stack web application that allows customers to create accounts, submit support requests, schedule repairs, and access a knowledge base for diagnosing problems and fixing minor hardware and software issues.

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Account Management**: The system should allow users to create and manage their accounts.
2. **Support Request Submission**: Users should be able to submit support requests detailing their issues.
3. **Repair Scheduling and Quotation**: The system should enable users to schedule repairs and receive cost estimates.
4. **Knowledge Base Access**: The system should provide a knowledge base that users can access to diagnose problems and learn how to fix minor issues.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**: The system should be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that can be easily navigated by users of all levels of computer literacy.
2. **Performance**: The system should be able to handle a large number of users and requests without significant delays or crashes.
3. **Security**: User data should be securely stored and transmitted, with appropriate measures in place to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Scalability**: The system should be designed in a way that allows for easy expansion and addition of new features in the future.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **User Satisfaction**: Measured through user surveys and feedback.
2. **System Uptime**: The system should be available for use as much as possible.
3. **Response Time**: The time taken to respond to user requests and queries should be minimal.
4. **Issue Resolution Time**: The time taken to resolve user issues should be tracked and minimized.

### Risks and Implications

1. **Data Security**: There is a risk of data breaches, which could compromise user data. This can be mitigated by implementing robust security measures.
2. **System Downtime**: Any downtime can affect the company's operations and customer satisfaction. Regular maintenance and monitoring can help prevent this.
3. **Cost Overruns**: The development of the system could potentially exceed the initial budget. This can be mitigated by careful project management and regular budget reviews.

## Software Design Documents

### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements Specifications

The functional and non-functional requirements have been outlined in the previous section. These will guide the development of the system and ensure that it meets the needs of Dern-Support and its customers.

### Algorithm Design Documentation

The system will be designed using a combination of flowcharts and pseudocode to outline the logic and flow of the application. This will include algorithms for user authentication, support request submission, repair scheduling, and knowledge base access.

### Visual Design Documentation

The visual design of the system will be created using wireframes and mockups. This will provide a visual representation of the user interface and help guide the development of the front-end of the application.

### Data Requirements Design

The data requirements for the system will be outlined using entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) and data dictionaries. This will define the data that needs to be stored and how it will be structured in the database.

### Accessibility and Inclusivity Considerations

The system will be designed with accessibility and inclusivity in mind. This will include alternative layouts for users with visual impairments and support for inclusive technologies such as screen readers.

### Reused/Refactored Components

Where possible, the system will make use of existing solutions or third-party sources. This could include libraries for user authentication, database management, and front-end frameworks.

## Development of the Full Stack Solution

The full stack solution will be developed based on the designs and requirements outlined above. This will involve the creation of a front-end user interface, a back-end server, and a database for storing user data and support requests.

The solution will be tested using a variety of methods, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests. Any issues identified during testing will be addressed and the solution will be refined based on feedback from users and stakeholders.

## Evaluation of the Solution

The final step will be to evaluate the solution, considering its efficiency, effectiveness, and the extent to which it meets the requirements outlined in the scenario. This evaluation will be supported by evidence from the development and testing stages, and will suggest ways in which the software solution could be further developed in the future.

## Evidence Checklist

-   Software project proposal
-   Design documents for a full stack solution
-   Feedback on the documentation/designs collected from others
-   Improved version of the documentation/design
-   Written justification of design decisions
